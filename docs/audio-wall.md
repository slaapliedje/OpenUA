# Audio / music / sound subsystem — findings + worklist

Goal: make the port audible — UI beep, combat/event SFX, then `.slb` music.
**Today sound is fully muted by design:** the dispatch + bank-load layers are
lifted, but **every actual audio-output leaf is a stub**, and the engine never
calls the (already-real) Sound Manager shim or the (already-real) Falcon DMA HAL.
The substrate is unusually mature; the missing piece is the engine→HAL glue.

> KEY FINDING: **FRUA does NOT use the high-level Mac Sound Manager.**
> `_SoundDispatch` (0xa800) appears nowhere in any CODE segment. The `.slb` is a
> *sampled-sound bank* loaded as data, and playback is via the Mac **Device
> Manager** (`_Write`/`_Control` param blocks to a sound *driver*). So "port the
> Sound Manager" is the wrong framing — the faithful target is to reproduce the
> `.slb` mixer pump + the IO-param-block playback leaves, routing their buffers to
> the Atari DMA HAL instead of a Mac driver `_Write`.

## The sound dispatch flow (and where it dies)

Two trigger paths reach `jt52`, the dispatcher (boot.c:18587; cmd 255=stop,
0/1=mute, 2=drain, 3–15=beat/sfx, 32–39=song):

- **A. UI / combat SFX** — e.g. boot.c:25851 `jt52((hit)?5:4)`. cmd 3–15:
  - `-17444==0` (driver not loaded): spins ~2 ticks + pokes `jt1122(1,2,127)` —
    a **menu-slot poke, not a sample**. Silent.
  - `-17444!=0`: `jt965(...)` → boot.c:18568 → **PROBE stub. No sound.**
- **B. Dungeon event "PLAY SOUNDS"** — `l709e` case 17 → `l3ac6(ev)`
  (boot.c:3266, **stub**); faithfully loops ev[4..13] into jt52. `l40b4()`
  (3252, **stub**) is an event-sound pre-hook before cases 4/11/26/27/34.
- **Song path** — jt52 cmd 32–39 → `l5876(cmd-32)` → `jt985` (18562, **stub**) →
  faithfully `l11a2` (**missing**), the note-stream player over the `.slb` bank.

Every path bottoms out in a PROBE stub (jt965 / jt985 / jt974 / l3ac6 / l40b4)
**before** any sample reaches hardware. The Falcon DMA backend that *could* play
is never invoked.

## What the Mac side does (the faithful behaviour to reproduce)

Grounded in CODE_05.s:
- **`.slb` load (data, not driver):** `jt986`/`MLoad` (CODE5+0x10f0) appends
  `"slb"`, loads via `jt975`, allocs the sample pool `-4770`, installs `jt974`
  as the per-tick mixer pump at A5 `-4774`.
- **Playback via Device Manager:** jt965's output leaf `L7ee0` (CODE_05.s:11604)
  builds an IO param block in A5 `-3138..-3094` and calls `L5716` — a thin
  wrapper around the `_Write` trap (0xa003/0xa403). Siblings: `_Control`,
  `_Status`, `_GetVol`. So the engine drives a **sound device driver** with
  PBWrite/PBControl param blocks.
- jt965 gates on JT[1154] (sound-on), loads the resource via jt468, loops `L7ee0`
  `count*reps` times. jt985 gates on song count `-4758` then calls `L11a2` to
  stream notes.
- **Sample format:** 8-bit PCM; `l7eb8`/`jt964` sign-flip signed↔excess-128 —
  exactly the conversion the Falcon DMA path also needs.

## The Atari target (scoping only — `platform/` concern)

Per the layer rule, hardware lives in `platform/`; engine must not touch XBIOS.
The HAL already exists and is correct:
- `platform/sound_falcon.c:94` — `plat_sound_play_mono8()` does the real path:
  `Locksnd`/`Setbuffer(SR_PLAY)`/`Setmode(MONO)`/`Devconnect(...)`/`Buffoper`,
  DMA buffer in ST-RAM via `Mxalloc(count,0)`, CODEC rate-match (Mac 22 kHz →
  CLK20K/19668 Hz). API in `platform/include/plat_sound.h`.
- `compat/sound.c` already parses Mac `snd ` resources + converts unsigned→signed
  and calls that HAL — but is **dead code** (engine never calls `SndPlay`).
- **TT030 caveat:** Falcon030 = 8-bit stereo DMA + DSP56001; TT030 = YM2149 PSG
  only (no DMA sound). The HAL must degrade gracefully; TT path unimplemented.
- **SysBeep** (compat/sound.c:226) has no backend yet — TODO XBIOS `Dosound`/YM2149.

The missing glue is **between** the engine and this HAL: jt965/jt974/jt985 need
bodies that take the loaded `.slb` sample data and hand it to
`plat_sound_play_mono8`, rather than the Mac `_Write`-to-driver mechanism. Since
the `.slb` stores raw 8-bit PCM (jt975 loads it; jt964/l7eb8 convert it), this is
mostly lifting L7ee0/L11a2/jt974 to push buffers into the HAL.

> Corrections to prior docs: **`jt17` is NOT a sound function** (it's a class/HD
> calc, boot.c:25459). **`jt988` is NOT the `.slb` loader** (it's a char/path
> classifier; band5-wall.md:12 mislabels it — the real loader is `jt986`).

## What works vs muted

- **Works (load/decode/HAL):** bank loader (jt986/jt975/jt964/l3736/l7eb8),
  dispatcher (jt52) + voice bookkeeping, mute toggles, menu-tone helpers, the
  Falcon DMA backend, the `snd ` parser.
- **Stub/missing (every actual playback):** jt965 (sfx), jt985 + l11a2 (song),
  jt974 (mixer), l7ee0 (output leaf), l3ac6 (event sounds), l40b4 (event hook),
  SysBeep (tone).
- **Confirmed muted:** the engine calls `SndPlay`/`SndNewChannel` **zero** times
  (only SysBeep via jt1147, itself a logging stub). compat/sound.c +
  sound_falcon.c are compiled in but **dead, never reached.** Even when
  `-17444=1`, jt965/jt985 are PROBE stubs. **No sample ever reaches the DAC.**

## Blockers + open questions

1. **Bridge model mismatch:** Mac plays via Device Manager `_Write` to a driver;
   the HAL plays via Falcon DMA `Buffoper`. The lift must **re-route, not
   transliterate** — L7ee0/L11a2/jt974 need an adapter to `plat_sound_play_mono8`.
2. **GLIB FAR-pool not wired:** l59d6 (51676) notes jt459 reads 0, so the Mac
   low-mem check is bypassed (-17444 forced to 1). Confirm `music.slb` + `sounds`
   group 18 actually load in Hatari before any audio can work.
3. **Async/mixing:** jt974 is a per-tick mixer over a 5-voice table; the HAL today
   is single-buffer fire-and-forget (`plat_sound_playing()` always 0). Multi-voice
   needs software mixing into one DMA buffer, or the DSP.
4. **Sample rate/format of the `.slb`** — confirm against an actual dump (shim
   assumes 22 kHz / stdSH 8-bit).
5. **TT030 has no DMA sound** — needs a YM2149 fallback or accept silence on TT.

## Plan — multi-part subsystem, small increments

1. **Smallest first step (1 session) — `SysBeep`/UI beep:** give compat/sound.c:226
   a real tone via XBIOS `Dosound` (YM2149) or a tiny canned sample through
   `plat_sound_play_mono8`. Makes jt1147 alert beeps audible and **proves the
   engine→HAL path end-to-end.** Lowest risk, no `.slb` dependency.
2. **SFX (`jt965` + `l7ee0`):** lift jt965's body (gate on sound-on, jt468-load
   the resource, loop the output leaf) + write l7ee0 as an adapter that hands the
   8-bit PCM to `plat_sound_play_mono8` instead of `_Write`. Wire `l3ac6` (event
   PLAY SOUNDS) once jt965 works. Most player-visible win (combat hit/miss).
3. **Music (`jt974` pump + `jt985`/`l11a2`) — largest:** the `.slb` song engine
   with the per-tick 5-voice mixer. The real work; needs the multi-voice mixing
   question resolved (software-mix into one DMA buffer, possibly DSP). Defer until
   SFX is proven.

Validate each step against the load path (l59d6/jt986) actually pulling
`music.slb`/`sounds` group 18 in Hatari first — otherwise there's no sample data
to play regardless of the output leaves.
